## To improve

- Transitions
  - From compose to fractal & composition vs. inheritance
  - To curry and partial application
  - What if I want to ? (side effects)
  - To "pure functions === easy tests" and the example after
- `join` in curry example

Read the book again, the start/end of chapters, how is the transition?


## Ideas & things to change from v1

Cover the problem we try to solve

Don't put the "why" separated, instead have it as conclusion

Resources -> mentions (less)

Interactive examples with REPL in the slides (like Sanctuary/Ramda)
